Thinking in XML Assignment

1. While both are primarily ways of transferring and organizing text data, HTML appears
to be more concerned with how that same data is displayed than its counterpart.
2. XML tags are beneficial because they can be incredibly more descriptive, precise,
and, in my opinion, more simple than those in HTML which lack variety and specificity.
3. However, that variety could be too much of a good thing as it makes it harder to be
read into other file formats and tends to create larger file sizes.
